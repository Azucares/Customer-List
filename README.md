# Customer-List
Swing interface to allow users to interface a database of customers (arrayed towards the copier industry)

Purpose:  This project uses a swing interface to provide the user with easy access 
          to customer information stored on a SQL server database.  multiple fields allow
          for a large combination of search parameters to be used to narrow down the search
          results.
          
Getting Started:  In order to make use of this project, you need an installed version of SQL Server.  And the
                  program will need access to the sqljdbc_auth.dll file in the JDBC driver.  Open the customer list program and enter the                   server information in the edit/server info dialog box, then run file/create database to have the database created on                       your server.  Once the database is created, you should be ready to begin entering new entries.

Built with:  JDBC, Swing components
